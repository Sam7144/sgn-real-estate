          <h5>How much does property management cost?</h5>
          <p>
            It depends on whether it is management for a short-term or long-term
            broker, or just managing a property without a tenant (some investors
            hold a property for their own use).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The long-term management fee is 15%</strong> of the rental
            amount, and is valid only if there is a tenant in the property, the
            fee includes the property rental fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Short-term rental</strong>consumes a lot of resources and
            time, but is more profitable, we manage the entire operation, the
            listing of the properties on leading websites, financial management,
            payment of taxes, payment of commissions, guest relations, cleaning,
            maintenance, permits, check in and check out, and make sure that the
            score will be at a high level, all this for a 25% commission from
            the profits, which gives us the interest to make the property is
            profitable as much as possible

          <h5>Can I stay at my property when I visit Budapest?</h5>
          <p>
            It depends on the type of rental in the property. When the property
            is intended for long-term rental, the contract is for one year and
            the tenant cannot be disturbed, and it is not possible to spend the
            night during the lease, but the lease can always be canceled if the
            tenant been notified 60 days in advance. If the property is intended
            for a short term, if the dates are available, the owner can always
            request and the company will block the dates on which the owner
            visits, in order to be safe, it is better to notify a long period of
            time in advance before the visi

            What is the guarantee that the tenants will not cause damage in the
            apartment?
          </h5>
          <p>
            Good question, the company has a great interest that the properties
            will always be at their best and that their value will not decrease,
            for this, the company employs a property inspector who checks the
            properties frequently and makes sure that there is no damage, if
            there is any damage caused by the tenant, he will be charged for
            repairs or costs immediately, this is part of the contract they
            signed, In addition to this, for a long-term rent, the tenant is
            required to pay a deposit of two months' rent, and the deposit will
            be returned later and only at the end of the contract and if there
            are no debts or damages. In the short term, every guest at the
            property from websites such as Booking.com or Airbnb takes a
            security credit card in case it causes damage to the property
